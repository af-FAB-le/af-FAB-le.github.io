The head-mounted camera is an extension of the [pan-tilt camera](/capush/pan-tilt-cam/) mounted on a headset, similar to the [clamp](/capush/clamp-cam) but worn by the person, enabling a first person viewpoint capture.
By attaching the unit once to the head, the maker can move around in the space wearing the head-mounted camera to go from an activity to another.
