A clamp camera is a mobile extension of the [pan-tilt camera](/capush/pan-tilt-cam/). It includes a battery pack and is mounted on a clamp, so that it can easily be moved and attached in the environment in different locations to get different points of view. 
This unit can thus be used to capture a scene from flexible points of view, providing the makers with a quick and simple way to set up their scene.

### Bill of material
