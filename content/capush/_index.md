Capush is a concept of modular capture units developed as part of a research project. 

The Capush concept builds on the assumption that a single capture unit is not sufficient to address the diverse needs when producing knowledge resources in fabrication workshops. A key aspect of Capush is thus to consider a fleet of capture units (multiplicity) composed of different unit *types* with different features (variety). Some of these features can be automatized (degree of automation).

This website provides an overview of proof-of-concept implementations of different unit types with which we experimented. We don't provide detailed tutorials how to recreate these units because we only implemented them as rough prototypes, that is, with lots of dangling cables and without proper cases which could everything nicely together and protect it from falls or other incidents likely occur in the day-to-day of a fabrication workshop.

Websocket based protocol to connect to units can be found on our [Github repository](https://github.com/af-FAB-le/capush)
